                    It has been two weeks since the last time I went outside. I have been
                    playing Stardew Valley non-stop. When will I get ten hearts with Alex? Can
                    I get that cauliflower for Jodie? How long until I can upgrade my backpack?
                    These are the only things that matter to me now. My life solely consists of
                    farming, mining, foraging and fishing. What does the real world look like?
                    It's been so long that I don't think I can even remember anymore.
