          It has been two weeks since the last time I went outside. I have been
          playing Stardew Valley non-stop. When will I get ten hearts with Alex? Can
          I get that cauliflower for Jodie? How long until I can upgrade my backpack?
          These are the only things that matter to me now. My life solely consists of
          farming, mining, foraging and fishing. What does the real world look like?
          It's been so long that I don't think I can even remember anymore.

        For eons man has faced many a question. Is humanity inherently evil?
        Is there a god? Is there a purpose of living? Among all these conundrums
        has been one greater one to rule them all. <em>Berenstein or Berenstain?</em>
        My entire life has been haunted by this question. For years, I believed it to
        be the Berenstein Bears. But this entire time, it's been Berenstain? Impossible.
        It can not be. What's next? Is Abraham Lincoln actually named Abrahem Lincoln?
        Ridiculous. There must be a reason that I believed it to be Berenstain. Has the
        government been brainwashing us this entire time? And if so, for what purpose?
        To brainwash an entire generation of children? That must be it.
